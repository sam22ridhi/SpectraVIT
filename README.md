# SpectraViT: Hybrid Spectral Analysis with Vision Transformers for Melanoma Classification

**SpectraViT** is a novel deep learning model designed to enhance melanoma classification through a combination of **Fourier transforms**, **Wavelet transforms**, and **Vision Transformers (ViT)**. The model combines the spectral analysis capabilities of Fourier and Wavelet transforms with the attention-driven feature extraction of Vision Transformers to capture both fine-grained and holistic details from dermatoscopic images of skin lesions.

## Overview

### Project Objective
The goal of SpectraViT is to improve the accuracy of binary classification of melanoma by:
- Utilizing spectral transformations to capture high-frequency details and textures.
- Leveraging the Vision Transformer’s capacity for capturing global dependencies within an image.
- Combining these techniques to create a hybrid model that performs both low-level feature extraction and high-level contextual analysis.

### Approach
SpectraViT integrates Fourier and Wavelet transforms as preprocessing steps, with a Vision Transformer layer to aggregate both local and global information from the images. The main steps in SpectraViT are as follows:

1. **Fourier Transform Layer**: Extracts high-frequency components of the image, enhancing the model’s ability to identify textural details.
2. **Wavelet Transform Layer**: Performs a multi-level decomposition (Level 2 Haar wavelet) to capture spatial-frequency features at different resolutions.
3. **Hybrid Pooling**: Combines outputs from the Fourier and Wavelet transforms to reduce dimensions while retaining essential features.
4. **Vision Transformer**: Processes the spectral information as well as spatial context, enhancing the model’s ability to understand the structure and distribution of image patterns.

### Results
- **Accuracy**: SpectraViT achieves an accuracy of *92%** on the melanoma classification dataset, showing a **2%** improvement over standard ViT.
- **Robustness**: The model is resilient to noise and effectively captures both fine and coarse details, making it suitable for medical imaging tasks where precision is crucial.
