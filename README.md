# SpectraViT: Hybrid Spectral Analysis with Vision Transformers for Melanoma Classification

**SpectraViT** is a novel deep learning model designed to enhance melanoma classification through a combination of **Fourier transforms**, **Wavelet transforms**, and **Vision Transformers (ViT)**. The model combines the spectral analysis capabilities of Fourier and Wavelet transforms with the attention-driven feature extraction of Vision Transformers to capture both fine-grained and holistic details from dermatoscopic images of skin lesions.

## Overview

### Project Objective
The goal of SpectraViT is to improve the accuracy of binary classification of melanoma by:
- Utilizing spectral transformations to capture high-frequency details and textures.
- Leveraging the Vision Transformer’s capacity for capturing global dependencies within an image.
- Combining these techniques to create a hybrid model that performs both low-level feature extraction and high-level contextual analysis.

### Approach
SpectraViT integrates Fourier and Wavelet transforms as preprocessing steps, with a Vision Transformer layer to aggregate both local and global information from the images. The main steps in SpectraViT are as follows:

1. **Fourier Transform Layer**: Extracts high-frequency components of the image, enhancing the model’s ability to identify textural details.
2. **Wavelet Transform Layer**: Performs a multi-level decomposition (Level 2 Haar wavelet) to capture spatial-frequency features at different resolutions.
3. **Hybrid Pooling**: Combines outputs from the Fourier and Wavelet transforms to reduce dimensions while retaining essential features.
4. **Vision Transformer**: Processes the spectral information as well as spatial context, enhancing the model’s ability to understand the structure and distribution of image patterns.

### Results
- **Accuracy**: SpectraViT achieves an accuracy of **X%** on the melanoma classification dataset, showing a **Y%** improvement over standard ViT.
- **Robustness**: The model is resilient to noise and effectively captures both fine and coarse details, making it suitable for medical imaging tasks where precision is crucial.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SpectraViT.git
   cd SpectraViT
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset**
   Download the melanoma classification dataset and place it in the appropriate directory. Update `train_data_path` in the code to reflect the location of the training images.

## Usage

### Training SpectraViT
To train the SpectraViT model on the melanoma dataset:
```bash
python train.py --epochs 30 --batch_size 32 --learning_rate 0.0001
```

### Evaluating the Model
To evaluate the model on a validation or test dataset:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path ./checkpoints/spectra_vit.pth
```

### Model Architecture
Here’s a summary of the main components in the SpectraViT model:

- **FourierLayer**: Applies Fourier transforms to the input image, capturing frequency domain information.
- **WaveletLayer**: Decomposes the input image using a Level 2 Haar wavelet transform, capturing features across multiple scales.
- **HybridPoolingLayer**: Reduces the dimensionality of Fourier and Wavelet output, keeping only essential features.
- **Vision Transformer Encoder**: Processes the combined spectral data, capturing complex spatial and contextual information.
- **Classifier**: A fully connected layer that outputs binary predictions for melanoma classification.

## Experiments and Results

### Experimental Setup
The model was trained on a dataset of dermatoscopic images with **X training samples** and **Y validation samples** using an 80-20 split. The training process was configured as follows:

- **Optimizer**: AdamW with a learning rate of 0.0001 and weight decay of 1e-4.
- **Learning Rate Scheduler**: Cosine Annealing to adjust the learning rate over 30 epochs.
- **Loss Function**: CrossEntropyLoss for binary classification.

### Performance Metrics

|----------------|----------------|
| Accuracy       | **X%**         |
| Precision      | **X%**         |
| Recall         | **X%**         |
| F1 Score       | **X%**         |

### Results Summary
SpectraViT demonstrates a significant improvement in capturing both the fine-grained and global features essential for melanoma classification. The combined Fourier and Wavelet layers effectively preprocess the images to enhance feature representation, while the Vision Transformer further refines and contextualizes the data for robust predictions.

## Future Work
